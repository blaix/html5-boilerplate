# Absolute Bare Minimum HTML5 Boilerplate

All it does is make sure most browsers recognize the new tags so you can style
them, does a style reset, and then sets some sane defaults (`article`s are
`display:block` for example). If you need more whiz bang features than that,
you should use [this](http://html5boilerplate.com/) instead.

Stolen pretty much line for line from
[HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/)'s
[boilerplates](http://html5doctor.com/html-5-boilerplates/) and
[reset stylesheet](http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/). That site
is awesome.
